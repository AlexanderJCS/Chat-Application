# Chat-Application
A simple chatting application within Python.

To run a server, change the IP constant to your local IP. If you want people to join from outside your LAN, port forward whichever port the PORT constant is and have people connect to your public IP address (can be found by searching "What is my IP" in google).

To connect to a server, simply input the IP of the server and the port you are connecting to. After, input a username and start chatting in the GUI.
